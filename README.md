## Why This Tool?

Most analytics platforms show you conversion rates, but they don't answer the critical questions:

1. **Where is the biggest revenue leak?**
2. **What's the dollar value of improving each stage?**
3. **Which improvements should we prioritize?**

This calculator does all three, helping you focus optimization efforts where they'll have the biggest business impact.

## How to Use

### 1. Configure Your Funnel

- Set your **Average Order Value**
- Choose the **number of stages** (3-10)

### 2. Input Your Data

For each funnel stage:
- Customize the stage name (e.g., "Homepage", "Product Page", "Add to Cart")
- Enter the number of users at that stage

The calculator automatically:
- Calculates conversion rates between stages
- Identifies drop-off percentages
- Estimates revenue loss

### 3. Analyze Results

Review:
- **Overall metrics** â€” Conversion rate, total drop-offs, estimated revenue lost
- **Funnel visualization** â€” Interactive chart showing user flow
- **Revenue impact table** â€” Stage-by-stage breakdown with dollar values
- **What-if scenarios** â€” Model improvements and see projected revenue impact

## Example Use Case

**Scenario:** E-commerce jewelry site with $95 AOV

**Funnel:**
- Homepage: 100,000 users
- Product Pages: 75,000 users (25% drop-off)
- Add to Cart: 8,000 users (89% drop-off) ðŸ”´
- Checkout: 4,000 users (50% drop-off)
- Purchase: 2,300 users (42.5% drop-off)

**Insight:** The PDP â†’ ATC stage has an 89% drop-off rate, costing an estimated $6.3M in lost revenue.

**What-if:** A 10% improvement in ATC rate would generate +$34,675 monthly (+$416K annually).

**Action:** Prioritize product page optimization (trust signals, pricing clarity, social proof).
